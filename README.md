# Portfolio
A collection of Eric Jostad's projects over his career. 

Within this website portfolio there is an functional navigation bar, which correctly takes the user to the selected site page. 

Each page has a grid setup. The index page is divided with one row and two columns, which provide a summary of me and my work. 

The contact page is one row and one column which contains multiple forms that allow the user to input their contact information. 

The portfolio page is one row and one column that contains a functional carousel of stock images at this time that will eventaully showcase my completed projects.
